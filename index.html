          <p>Hello! I am Julie, I'm a singing graphic designer learning how to code!</p>

          <p>There's so much to tell you... First I love not only graphic design but functionality, welcome to front end development people!!! Oh and I use "!" more than anyone should.</p>
        
          <p>Now the singing, la la la! I grew up singing and I sing all the time. One notible gig I use to have is being the National Anthem singer at my alma mater, The University of Oklahoma. I am currently the lead singer of my band The Illusive Jute.</p>

          <p>I am a huge dog person and I have two of my own, Corgis named Lexi and Sadie. They two mighty joy's of my life. Corgi smiles are the best. </p>

          <p>I am currently a full time employee at DR Horton as a graphic designer in their corporate office located in Fort Worth, Texas (yeehaw!) My empahsis or niche if you will is working with imagery, such as detail clean ups in photoshop, branding for the divisions nationwide and assisting with the corporate social media channels. I've been working there for 2 years now.</p>

          <p>I enjoy solving riddles, Silicon Valley, cooking, and rightfully timed memes. Don't hesitate to reach out to me on my contact form, I'd love to get to know you!</p>
